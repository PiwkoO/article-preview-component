## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned

This challenge was interesting. I was able to play with different CSS and HTML tricks. There is a (let's say) recommendation for share button to work using JavaScript, but I thought it's not necessary so in this project you will see solution with pure CSS. I know these kind of tricks are useful in real life projects as well so, give it a look if you are as curious as I am.

```css
.css-triangle {
  border-top: 12px solid var(--main-color);
  border-left: 12px solid transparent;
  border-right: 12px solid transparent;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I want to test more of different approaches without using JavaScript. Sometimes it is just a fun fact to know, but sometimes it brings unconventional solutions which are helpful so why not.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Triangle](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/css-triangle/) - If you haven't had a chance to create triangle using CSS I recommend you to check out this article. It should give a better understanding on how and why it works.
